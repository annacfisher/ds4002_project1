Perry Jones,@supe_jones,Delaware! I’m excited to meet and talk with some good coaches and players!
Perry Jones,@supe_jones,"I say all this to say it’s ok to have football as plan A, but just know that this thing is short and you have to be ok when it ends. Be ready to roll into something else and give it everything just like you would in football. Take your education seriously."
Perry Jones,@supe_jones,"I don’t know who this is for but football is not your life. I hate to tell you but it’s going to come to an end a lot sooner than you’d like. Whether that is 1 year, 4 years, or even 10 years. What do you have to fall back on. I was depressed for 2 years after it ended for me."
Perry Jones,@supe_jones,@supe_jones: The Slash Backs are back in Williamsburg! Time to get better!! #MADEmen #developmentmatters

Ben Boulware,@benboulware7,LINEBACKERS - if you really want to be developed & be taught how to do this in the biggest games of your career…come to Clemson.
Ben Boulware,@benboulware7,Must be rookie hazing…😎🧡
Ben Boulware,@benboulware7,Full circle moment for me. Thankful for the opportunity. 🧡
Ben Boulware,@benboulware7,"I look back on my life so far and man it’s been a JOURNEY. The stories and memories that have happened in my life in the past 20+ years seem like I could fill a novel. From being a 10 year old running on the field after games, to being a young 14 year old freshman at TL Hanna trying to find his place in the world. To now being a 30 year old thats getting the opportunity of a lifetime. Boy it’s been an adventure. I’ve been at the top of the mountain and then at the very bottom of the valley. Im super grateful for all the people that I’ve met along the way. I’m even more grateful for the people that have made an impact on my life and have played a huge part in shaping me into the man I am today. My story isn’t finished though. I know I have a lot more life ahead of me. If I continue to love the Lord, love my wife/kids, and control the input each day, then it should be a good life. I can’t wait to see what the next 10 years holds because I know the best is yet to come. Wade, Sammy, Dee, Kobe, Jamal, Jeremiah, CJ, Drew, Logan, Fletcher, Griffin, Roberto, Billy & William, we’re about to go into the deep dark abyss boys. When you come up for air, you’ll be a grown ass man on the other side I promise. ""The best teams/organizations/churches/businesses provide/offer some level of pressure. Pressure is not inherently good or bad. Too much can be bad. Too little can be bad. The right amount can produce things that are extremely helpful. Pressure can make diamonds or burst pipes. The best leaders are always creating pressure and leading under it.”  @rileycummings"

Rodney McCloud,@Rodney_McLeod4,Im taking Eagles over Packers. Things to watch. How much will the Eagles be able to run the ball versus a 6th rank rushing defense. Can Jalen find his rhythm with his wideouts despite missing the last 2 games. Packers must commit to the run with Josh Jacobs. Which Eagles defense
Rodney McCloud,@Rodney_McLeod4,Lamar unstoppable right now. Pleading his case for MVP
Rodney McCloud,@Rodney_McLeod4,Joe Mixon single handedly closed the game out. You MUST have a run game in the playoffs.
